# Skip Hire Services - Frontend Implementation

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, responsive web application for a skip hire service company. It allows users to browse, filter, and select different skip sizes for hire in the NR32 area with an intuitive and engaging user interface.

## My Approach

### UI/UX Design Philosophy

I approached this project with a focus on creating an intuitive, visually appealing interface that guides users through the skip selection process. Key considerations included:

- **User-Centric Design**: Simplified the selection process with clear visual cues and interactive elements
- **Accessibility**: Ensured proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all device sizes from mobile to desktop
- **Performance**: Implemented efficient rendering techniques to maintain smooth interactions

### Technical Implementation

#### Component Architecture

I structured the application using reusable, modular components to ensure maintainability and scalability:

- **Expandable Card System**: Implemented using Aceternity UI components to create a visually engaging card system that expands to show detailed information
- **Filter System**: Created an intuitive filtering mechanism that helps users quickly find skips that match their specific requirements
- **Selection Flow**: Designed a multi-step selection process with visual feedback at each stage

#### Animation and Interaction

To enhance the user experience, I implemented:

- Smooth transitions between states using the Motion library
- Micro-interactions that provide feedback for user actions
- Animated card expansions that maintain context while revealing additional information

#### Technical Choices

- **Next.js**: Leveraged the latest features of Next.js 15 for optimal performance and developer experience
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout for type safety and improved code quality
- **TailwindCSS**: Implemented for consistent styling and responsive design
- **Custom Hooks**: Created reusable logic like `useOutsideClick` for improved component behavior

## Features Implemented

- Interactive skip catalog with expandable cards
- Filtering system for different skip types and requirements
- Detailed information display for each skip option
- Persistent selection bar for improved user flow
- Responsive design that works across all device sizes
- Animated transitions for a polished user experience

## Future Enhancements

Given more time, I would consider implementing:

- A more sophisticated filtering system with additional parameters
- User preference saving using local storage
- A checkout process with address validation
- Integration with a backend for real-time availability
- Improved accessibility features for users with disabilities.
